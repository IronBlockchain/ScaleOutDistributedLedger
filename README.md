## Node ##

### Meta knowledge ###
We keep track of what each node knows. We call this `metaKnowlege`: what we know that they know. Each node contains a Map from nodes to integers, where the integer represents the last block that we know for sure that the receiver has. 

The meta knowledge is updated whenever we receive a transaction from that node and when we send a transaction to that node.

### Smart proof collection ###
When sending a proof for a transaction, we use our metaKnowledge of the receiver to select the blocks that we send. We send only the part of the chain that we expect that the receiver doesn't have, up to the last committed block of that chain. Combined with Algorithm 3, this ensures that we send as little information as possible.

## Algorithm 3: Non-interactive Smart Transacting Algorithm ##
The algorithm in the paper basically requires the use of a powerset of all unspent transactions. Since this requires O(2^n) sets, this is only feasible for small numbers of n.

The algorithm implemented is smarter and eliminates bad combinations by keeping track of a best-so-far. It has the same worst case performance, O(2^n), e.g. if all unspent transactions are required for the transaction. If this is not the case however (you send a part of your money), then the performance of the implemented algorithm is much better. The less transactions are required as sources, the better this algorithm performs.

#### Step 1 ####
First we collect all unspent transactions (these are tracked in application). We then create a TransactionTuple for each transaction, which will calculate which chains would need to be sent based on what the receiver already knows.

#### Step 2 ####
Check if there are single transactions that have a large enough amount to be used as the only source. If we find at least one of these, then all transactions that require more chains than the best single source are directly eliminated. (Combining those transactions with other transactions would only make the required set of chains bigger, so they will never be in the best choice)

We call the resulting set `candidates`.

If there are less than two candidates we stop and return the best-so-far.

#### Step 3 ####
We have a set of TransactionTuples `currentRound`, which is initially set to `candidates`.
We have a set of TransactionTuples `nextRound`, which is initially empty.

For at most `candidates.size() - 1` rounds, we do the following:
- We iterate over the candidates. We try to combine each candidate with each element of `currentRound`.
    - If the combination requires more than or the same number of chains than the best-so-far, then it is eliminated.
    - Otherwise:
        - If it is able to cover the costs, we set it as best-so-far.
        - Otherwise, we add this combination to `nextRound`.
- If there are less than two combinations selected for the next round, then the algorithm returns the best-so-far.
- Otherwise, `currentRound := nextRound` and `nextRound := []` (empty).

### Result ###
The final combination of transactions returned is the **smallest** set of sources with minimum amount of chains required.

### Performance ###
The performance of the algorithm is still O(2^n) in the worst case. The worst case would be if all transactions are needed to get the amount of money required. Then the algorithm will consider all possible combinations.

### Future optimizations ###
* It would probably be useful to keep track of how much money we have, to prevent the costly case where we don't have enough money.
* It could be beneficial to group transactions together that have the same chain requirements in the first step, and use these as the input for the current implementation instead of the individual transactions. Grouping transactions together can be done in O(|transactions|) by hashing them into buckets.
* There could be 2 algorithms, one for when we expect many transactions will be required, one for when we expect only a few transactions will be required. The current algorithm works bottom up, the other algorithm could work top down. (How many transactions do we need at minimum to cover the transaction?)

### Implementation Details ###
BitSets are used as a convenient and efficient way to represent the chains that are required. They represent a sequence of bits of a particular size (e.g. 1000 bits).
* The bit at index 0 represents chain 0, the bit at index 1 represents chain 1, etc.
* A bit with a value of 1 means that the corresponding chain is required.
* Combining the chains required of 2 tuples is done with a bitwise or.
* The number of chains required is the cardinality of a bitset.
* Removing the chains that the receiver already knows is done with a bitwise andNot.

## Tracker Server
The tracker server can be installed by installing NodeJS and running `npm install` in the tracker-server folder. After this it can be run by running `npm start` in that same folder.

## Main Chain
For the main chain we use [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/). We can communicate to this chain using the provided ABCI interface. 

### Running tendermint
Initialize tendermint and run a node using the following commands:  
`./tendermint init`  
`./tendermint node --consensus.create_empty_blocks=false` (Note that Tendermint creates empty blocks by default)

See the [tendermint documentation](https://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/using-tendermint.html) for more information.
